<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 11, 2026<br>
    <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 11, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Market Track mobile application ("the App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>

<p>By accessing or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

<p>Your use of the App is also subject to the terms and conditions of the platform from which you downloaded the App, including the Apple App Store Terms of Service or Google Play Terms of Service, as applicable.</p>

<h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h2>

<p>The App provides access to financial market information and analytical tools. Specific instruments, features, and markets available may vary by region.</p>

<p>The App requires an active internet connection for certain features and services. The App does not require user registration.</p>

<h2>3. ELIGIBILITY AND PERMITTED USE</h2>

<p>The App is intended for individuals aged 16 years or older. By using the App, you represent that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>The App is provided for personal, non-commercial informational use only.</strong> You may not use the App for professional advisory services, client management, commercial research, or any purpose involving third parties without express written permission.</p>

<h2>4. REGULATORY STATUS</h2>

<p><strong>WE ARE NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, INVESTMENT ADVISOR, LICENSED BROKER-DEALER, OR REGISTERED ENTITY UNDER ANY FINANCIAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY.</strong></p>

<p>We do not facilitate, execute, or provide trading services, brokerage services, investment management, or custody of assets.</p>

<h2>5. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE</h2>

<p><strong>THE APP IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT PROVIDE FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TRADING, TAX, OR LEGAL ADVICE.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing in the App constitutes a recommendation, solicitation, endorsement, or offer to buy or sell any financial instrument. You are solely responsible for your own investment decisions and any financial consequences thereof.</p>

<p>You should consult with qualified financial, legal, and tax professionals before making any investment decisions. Any data or tools provided in the App are for informational reference only and not for tax reporting, regulatory compliance, official financial recordkeeping, or any official purposes.</p>

<p>No fiduciary, advisory, agency, partnership, joint venture, or client relationship is created between you and us by your use of the App.</p>

<h2>6. CALCULATIONS, METRICS, AND VALUATIONS</h2>

<h3>6.1 No Guarantee of Accuracy</h3>

<p><strong>ANY CALCULATIONS, METRICS, VALUATIONS, STATISTICS, PERCENTAGES, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, OR OTHER COMPUTED VALUES DISPLAYED IN THE APP ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND MAY BE INACCURATE, INCOMPLETE, OR INCORRECT.</strong></p>

<h3>6.2 Basis of Calculations</h3>

<p>All calculations and metrics in the App are based on third-party market data that may differ from broker data or exchange data, may be delayed or incorrect, and are computed locally on your device without validation. <strong>Different data providers may supply different prices for the same instrument. Calculations based on different price sources will produce different results.</strong></p>

<h3>6.3 Corporate Actions and Adjustments</h3>

<p><strong>The App may not automatically account for or adjust data based on corporate actions including stock splits, dividends, mergers, delistings, or other events. Failure to account for such events will result in inaccurate calculations and metrics.</strong></p>

<h3>6.4 Official Records Take Precedence</h3>

<p><strong>DO NOT RELY ON APP CALCULATIONS OR METRICS FOR OFFICIAL PURPOSES.</strong> If you maintain brokerage accounts, always rely on official broker statements, trade confirmations, and tax documents as your authoritative source of financial information. In case of any discrepancy, your official records are the authoritative source.</p>
